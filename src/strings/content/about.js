    biography:
        `I’m Miguel Fernandez, originally from the paradisiacal island of Cozumel, Quintana Roo. I am currently studying Computer Systems Engineering at the Instituto Tecnológico Superior de Felipe Carrillo Puerto, with a special focus on software development.

My fascination with software development began when I was 17 years old, driven by curiosity, and I took my first Java course. Since then, I haven't stopped learning.

I’ve been involved in various projects both within and outside the university, including teaching programming workshops using the Micro:bit microcontroller in schools throughout the Mayan region of Quintana Roo. Additionally, I was part of the Segundo Verano de Investigación Científica 2023, where I contributed to the development of a chatbot designed to identify potential suicidal tendencies in blogs and social media.

I consider myself an energetic, adventurous, and dynamic person. I enjoy learning new technologies, putting them into practice, and constantly growing to deliver quality in every project I participate in.

Currently, my focus is on front-end development and user experience (UX), using tools like Figma for design and layout. However, I also enjoy full-stack development, as I love collaborating in teams and believe that contributing in different areas is essential.`,

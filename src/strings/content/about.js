    biography:
        `Hello! I'm Miguel Fernandez, a recent graduate in Computer Systems Engineering from the Instituto Tecnológico Superior de Felipe Carrillo Puerto, originally from the beautiful island of Cozumel, Quintana Roo.

My passion for software development began at 17 with a Java course that sparked my curiosity, and I haven’t looked back since. Over the years, I’ve gained experience through impactful projects that helped me develop strong problem-solving skills across mobile, web, and scripting development environments.

Some of my most notable work includes co-developing a crisis response platform during Hurricane Otis, creating a web scraping framework to support AI research on suicidal behavior, and leading the design and development of a cross-platform app for managing academic projects between students and teachers using Flutter, Firebase, and Google Cloud.

While I value versatility and enjoy working across the full stack, my primary interest lies in backend development—especially designing distributed systems that are scalable, reliable, and concurrency-tolerant. I enjoy exploring technologies that help solve real-world challenges and bring value through thoughtful engineering.

Curious, driven, and always ready to learn, I thrive in collaborative environments and take pride in delivering high-quality work through clean architecture and efficient teamwork.
